# Linear Control Design -Matlab-

*Project on Linear Control Design course*

The excercise description, as well as my answer are in greek language. The code and its comments are in english.

Basically there are 5 parts:
1. Decide if the system is stable using the Ruth-Hurwitz algorithm.
2. Add a controller to the system which has gain=K. With precision=0.1, decide K, so that
the overshoot of the unitary step response being <5%. Comment on the role of the controller to the system.
3. For the K that you chose, examine the stability of the system with the use of Ruth-Hurwitz and the Nyquist diagram.
4. What will happen to the initial system if you add to the output signal the zero: (1/a)*(s+a) for 
different values of a? Comment and draw your conclusions. The unitary step response is the input signal.
5. Just like (3), study the effect of the addition of a pole: (γ*s+1) to our system's output signal, 
for different values of γ.Comment and draw conclusions. The unitary step response is the input signal.
